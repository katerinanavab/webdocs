# CodeCollab Homework Instructions

### How to Start
1. Find the discussion assignment on **BlackBaud**.
2. Follow the provided link to the **Replit** program.
3. Select `FORK` to **make your own copy** of the program to **run**, **test**, and **modify** the code.
   
  > Your forked copy of the program will be saved in the `MY REPLS` section of Replit. You can always access my original copy at the provided link and fork a new copy if you need to start over.
  
### Discussion Requirements

{: .highlight }
To earn full credit, you must contribute at least **two (2) valid comments** in the discussion before Friday night. See the below section for more detailed guidelines for what qualifies as a "valid" or "acceptable" comment.

#### Checklist
- [ ] At least one (1) of your comments must be a **paragraph-long post** where you analyze/attempt to explain a section of code. This is considered your "individual contribution" and it's the most important part of the assignment.
  > * _Try to pick an area of the program that no one else has talked about yet._
  > * _Focus on small sections - do not attempt to explain the entire program by yourself!_
  > * _Use line numbers and vocabulary terms when referring to code._

- [ ] At least one (1) of your comments must be a **direct reply on another classmate's post**.
  > * _Save this part for later in the week._

### Guidelines & Tips

* 🛠️ Start by tinkering with and manipulating the existing code on your forked copy of the Replit program. 
  * **Make small changes one at a time**, press `RUN`, then observe the resulting **output**. This will help you visualize and understand the **cause and effect** of different code instructions.
* When writing your discussion post, **describe your process** of tinkering with the code and your **observations**.
* Try to explain what your observations mean in terms of higher level objectives (*like programming & computational thinking concepts*) and lower level objectives (_like syntax & vocabulary_).
  * *EX:* Explaining the overall goal / task achieved of a code section would count as a "higher level objective"
  * *EX:* Observing the use and purpose of symbols such as curly braces `{ }` would count as a "lower level objective"
* 📚 You are encouraged to **do research** and refer to the course notes, online textbooks, and reference websites like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). Feel free to **share links** to relevant and helpful articles, images, and videos!
  * Sharing links is a particularly great way to supplement your "response" comment, especially if your classmate asked a question or brought up something that needs further clarification.
* 🔍 CodeCollabs are **exploratory** endeavors - think of the process like a science experiment. Work submitted will NOT be checked on "correctness" of responses. Rather, the articulation of your thought process. Thus, it's less important that you get the "right answer" and more important that you record your thinking process as descriptively as possible. Attempt to use technical vocabulary often - it's OK if you use a term incorrectly, but you should always try!
  * _What did you notice about the code or the output?_
  * _What did you realize after changing part of the code?_
  * _What questions did it generate?_
  * _What parallels did you see?_
  * _What research did you do?_
