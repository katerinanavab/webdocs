# 💬 CodeCollab Homework Instructions

<!--
UPDATE TO REFLECT CHANGE FROM REPLIT TO GITHUB!!!

### Getting Started
1. Locate the discussion assignment for the current week on **BlackBaud**.
2. Follow the provided link to open the **Replit** program.
3. Click `FORK` to **make your own copy** of the program to **run**, **test**, and **modify** the code.
   
  > Your **forked copy** of the program will be saved in the `MY REPLS` section of Replit. You can always access my **original copy** at the provided link and fork a new copy if you need to start over.
-->

### Discussion Requirements

{: .important }
You must contribute at least **two (2) valid comments** in the Blackbaud discussion before `Friday @ 11:59PM` to earn full credit. See below for more detailed guidelines for what qualifies as an acceptable comment.

#### Checklist:
- [ ] At least one (1) of your comments must be a **paragraph-long post** where you analyze/attempt to explain a section of code. This is considered your "individual contribution" and it's the most important part of the assignment.
  * Focus on **small sections** - _DO NOT attempt to explain the entire program by yourself!_
  * This is a collaborative effort - _try to pick an area that no one else has talked about yet._
  * Be specific - _use line numbers and vocabulary terms when referring to code._

- [ ] At least one (1) of your comments must be a **direct reply on another classmate's post**.
  * Save this part for later in the week.
  * Your response must **extend the conversation** in some way - _like expanding on a concept brought up, giving another example, asking a question, sharing a relevant resource, etc_.

### Guidelines & Tips

* 🛠️ Start by tinkering with and manipulating the given code on your forked copy of the program to understand how it works. 
  * **Make small changes** one at a time, press `RUN`, then observe the resulting **output**. This process will help you visualize the **cause and effect** of different code instructions.
  * *EX:* A simple "experiment" you can always do is to **delete/comment-out a single line of code** then see what happens.
* 📝 When writing your discussion post, **describe your process** of tinkering with the code and present your **observations**. Seek to explain what your observations mean in terms of both higher-level objectives (*like programming & computational thinking concepts*) and lower-level objectives (_like syntax & vocabulary_).
  * *EX:* Explaining the overall goal / task achieved of a code section would count as a "higher-level objective"
  * *EX:* Observing the use and purpose of symbols such as curly braces `{ }` would count as a "lower-level objective"
* 📚 You are encouraged to **do research** and refer to the course notes, online textbooks, and reference websites like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). Feel free to **include links** to relevant and helpful articles, images, and videos!
  * Sharing links is a particularly great way to supplement your "response" comment, especially if your classmate asked a question or brought up something that needs further clarification.
* 🔍 Keep in mind that a `CodeCollab` is an **exploratory** endeavor and you should approach it like an **experiment**. Work submitted will NOT be checked on "correctness" of responses, rather, the articulation of your thought process. Thus, it's less important that you get the "right answer" and more important that you record your thinking process as descriptively as possible.
  * _What did you notice about the code or the output?_
  * _What did you realize after changing part of the code?_
  * _What questions did it generate?_
  * _What parallels did you see?_
  * _What research did you do?_
