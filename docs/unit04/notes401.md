## The JavaScript (JS) Programming Language

*JavaScript* was initially created to "make web pages alive"!

{:.highlight}
📝 The programs coded in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and are run **automatically** as the page loads.

> **NOTE:** In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the **browser**, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine). The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JavaScript virtual machine".

### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
{:.no_toc}

🌐 _In-browser_ JavaScript can do everything related to **webpage manipulation** as well as **interaction** with the user and the webserver.

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

- ⭐️ Add **new HTML** to the page, **change** the existing content, **modify CSS** styles.
- ⭐️ React to user **actions**, like mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- ⭐️ Ask **questions** to the visitor, **display** messages and alerts.
- Remember the data on the client-side ("local storage").
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and [COMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) technologies).

### The script tag
{:.no_toc}

JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere **into an HTML document** using the `<script>` tag: 

```html
<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>
```

{:.highlight}
The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is **automatically executed** when the browser processes the tag. If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a **separate file**, like the `script.js` file already in your project repository.

Script files are attached to HTML with the `src` **attribute**:

```html
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
```

> Here, `/path/to/script.js` is an **absolute path** to the script from the site root. One can also provide a **relative path** from the current page. For instance, `src="script.js"`, just like `src="./script.js"`, would mean a file `"script.js"` in the current folder.

We can give a **full URL** as well. For instance:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
```

To attach **several scripts**, use multiple tags:

```html
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
…
```

{:.warning}
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are written _directly_ into HTML. More complex ones reside in **separate files**, like the `script.js` already in your repository. The benefit of a separate file is that **the browser will download it** and store it in its [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache). 
> Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only _once_. That reduces traffic and **makes pages load faster**!

### JS Code Structure

The first thing we'll study is the **building blocks** of JavaScript code.

<html>
<dl>
<dt>Syntax</dt>
<dd>The "grammar" rules of a programming language, which include meaningful <strong>symbols</strong>, <strong>keywords</strong>, and <strong>patterns</strong>.</dd>
<dt>Statements</dt>
<dd>Statements are <strong>syntax constructs</strong> and <strong>commands</strong> that perform <em>actions</em>.</dd>
</dl>
</html>

We've already seen a _statement_, `console.log('Hello world!');`, which shows the message "Hello, world!" in the **OUTPUT** frame.

{:.highlight}
We can include as many **statements** (_commands/instructions_) in our code as we want! Statements are separated with a **semicolon** (` ; `), which acts like a _stop sign_ 🛑 after an instruction.

#### Comments
{:.no_toc}

As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add *comments* which describe what the code does and why.

Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply **ignores** them.

{:.important}
**Single-line comments** start with _two forward slash_ characters `//`.

The rest of the line is considered a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own, or follow a statement.

Like here:
```js
// This comment occupies a line of its own
console.log('Hello');

console.log('World'); // This comment follows the statement
```

{:.important}
**Multiline comments** start with a _forward slash_ and an _asterisk_ <code>/&#42;</code>, and end with an _asterisk_ then a _forward slash_ <code>&#42;/</code>.

Like this:
```js
/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
console.log('Hello');
console.log('World');
```

The content of comments is **ignored**, so if we put code inside <code>/&#42; ... &#42;/</code>, it won't execute.

Sometimes it can be handy to _temporarily disable_ a part of code:

```js
/* Commenting out the code
console.log('Hello');
*/
console.log('World');
```
